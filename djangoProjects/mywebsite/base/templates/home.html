                <h4>My first job as a developer</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>
                This section can be used to briefly introduce yourself, your background, or the motivation behind your work.
                You might include how you started coding, what inspired you to become a developer, or what kind of projects
                you enjoy building.
            </p>

            <p>
                My first professional experience as a developer was a turning point in my career. It allowed me to apply
                theoretical knowledge to real-world problems while learning industry best practices, teamwork, and clean code
                principles.
            </p>

            <p>
                From this experience, it’s clear that I tend to take initiative and embrace challenges before overthinking them.
                This mindset has helped me grow quickly, adapt to new technologies, and stay confident when facing unfamiliar
                problems.

                <h5>My experience as a Developer</h5>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    I have worked as a full-stack developer, contributing to both frontend and backend development processes.
                    My role involved translating business requirements into functional, scalable, and maintainable solutions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Throughout my journey, I have collaborated closely with designers, product managers, and other developers,
                    gaining valuable experience in agile workflows, version control, and iterative development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each project has strengthened my problem-solving skills and reinforced the importance of writing clean,
                    well-documented, and testable code.

                <h5>What I Know</h5>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    I have hands-on experience with modern web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django.
                    I focus on building responsive, user-friendly interfaces backed by reliable server-side logic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to core technologies, I am comfortable working with databases, RESTful APIs, and frontend frameworks.
                    I regularly use Git for version control and have experience deploying applications to cloud platforms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I continuously refine my technical skills by following best practices, learning new tools, and staying up to
                    date with industry trends.

                <h5>How I Learn</h5>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    I learn best by building real projects and experimenting with new ideas. Hands-on practice allows me to quickly
                    understand concepts and identify areas that need improvement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When faced with a challenge, I research documentation, explore community resources, and break problems down
                    into smaller, manageable steps.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I believe continuous learning is essential in technology, and I actively seek feedback to improve both my
                    technical and professional skills.

                <h5>My Goals</h5>
                <hr>
                <p>
                My primary goal is to grow as a well-rounded software developer capable of designing efficient and scalable
                systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                I aim to work on impactful projects that solve real problems while contributing positively to a team and
                organization.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the long term, I strive to deepen my expertise, mentor others, and take on more responsibility in the
                development lifecycle.
