# Django Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of Django projects that I am building to improve my backend and full-stack development skills.

The projects start with simple, beginner-friendly concepts and gradually increase in complexity. Each project focuses on specific Django fundamentals such as models, views, templates, forms, authentication, and CRUD operations.

The goal of this repository is not only to build working applications, but also to demonstrate consistent learning, clean project structure, and progressive problem-solving.
